Text Summarisation using pre-trained model T5 model


Text summarization is a method of creating summarized versions of large text documents to extract meaning and general idea of corpus. Automatic text summarization has become a very important way of processing large text document in a efficient way. There are mainly two types. Extractive and abstractive methods. Extractive types statistical methods such as Bag of Words and extract sentences which has highest n-gram count. Abstractive methods use generative language model to create new sentences from the text. This work is on abstractive methods using pre-trained models and uses embeddings from T5 model. FLask framework has been used to give UI for the application.
